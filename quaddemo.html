    <h1>Quadrilateral demo - Cassowary Javascript</h1>
    <h3>By <a href="http://www.badros.com/greg">Greg J. Badros</a></h3>
    <p><em>Refactored and optimized by 
      <a href="http://infrequently.org">Alex Russell</a></em></p>
    <p>The below is a new (as of May 2011) all-javascript implementation of the bounded
    quadrilateral demonstration that was first released as part of the
      <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary/">Cassowary
      constraint solving toolkit</a>.  In addition to Javascript,
      there are also C++, Java, and Smalltalk implementations, and the
      C++ implementation is wrapped for use with Guile Scheme (see
      also <a href="http://scwm.sourceforge.net/">Scwm</a>) and
      Python. See
      the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary/cassowary-tr.pdf">full
      paper on the Cassowary algorithm by Alan Borning and Greg
      Badros</a>.</p>
    
    <p>In this demo, dozens of declarative constraints are used to
      represent an arbitrary quadrilateral, the midpoints of the four
      vertices, and the fact that the end points need to stay in the
      bounding rectangle of the canvas.  Mouse/touch gestures on any
      of the eight control points allow you to move that control
      point, and the entire constraint system is incrementally
      re-solved as you drag the control point.  You will see real-time
      evidence that the "interior" quadrilateral is always a
      parallelogram.</p>

    <p>Tested on Chrome 11 on Windows, Firefox 4.0.1 on Windows,
    Safari on an iPad 2.  See the <a href="quaddemo.js">source to the demo</a> (in <a href="http://cassowary.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cassowary/cassowary/js/quaddemo.js?view=markup">CVS</a>).</p>
