- Fix licensing headers, cleanup namespace usage, move new hash* impls into c.*
- Port the quads demo to use worker-hosted solver
- Update the Hashtable impl to use the built in Maps from harmony if available. Benchmark.
- Write perf tests, get them running under JSPerf harness
	- Port from C++ version:
		http://cassowary.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cassowary/cassowary/c%2B%2B/ClTests.cc?revision=1.55&content-type=text%2Fplain
- Increase complexity of demo to actually stress the solver in modern browser/hardware configs
	- Output some performance info.
- Define a JSON format for constraint loading
- Document API (after improving/fixing it)
